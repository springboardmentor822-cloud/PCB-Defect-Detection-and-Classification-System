PCB Vision AI Pro: Short Overview
This project is an Automated Quality Inspection System designed to detect and classify 6 types of manufacturing defects in PCBs using Deep Learning.

Key Workflow
Module 1-2 (Computer Vision): Uses Image Subtraction to compare a "Golden Template" with the test board and extracts Regions of Interest (ROI).

Module 3-4 (The Brain): An EfficientNet-B0 model classifies defects like Short Circuits, Missing Holes, and Mouse Bites.

Module 5-7 (Deployment): A Streamlit Web App (app.py) provides a real-time dashboard for users to upload images, visualize defects, and download CSV Prediction Logs.

Tech Stack
Processing: OpenCV (Thresholding & Contours).

Deep Learning: PyTorch (EfficientNet-B0).

Interface: Streamlit (Web Dashboard).
