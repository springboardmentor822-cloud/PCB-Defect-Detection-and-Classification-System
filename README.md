# PCB-Defect-Detection-and-Classification-System
The PCB Defect Detection and Classification System aims to identify defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using image processing techniques. PCBs are critical components in electronic systems, and defects such as missing holes, open circuits, or misaligned tracks can affect device performance. Automating defect detection helps improve accuracy, reduce manual inspection time, and increase reliability in manufacturing processes.

This project is developed as part of the Infosys Internship Program and follows a modular approach to gradually build the complete system.

Project Status
       The project is completed up to Module 2 as per the internship timeline.

Work Completed
    Module 1 – Dataset Preparation and Testing
PCB image datasets were prepared and tested to ensure they are suitable for further processing. Initial validation and testing scripts were implemented to verify data consistency.

   Module 2 – Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction
ROI extraction techniques were implemented to identify and isolate important regions in PCB images where defects are likely to occur. This step helps focus analysis on critical areas and prepares the data for future defect classification.

Technologies Used
•Python
