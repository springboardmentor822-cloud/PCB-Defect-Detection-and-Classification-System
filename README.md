 🔍 PCB Defect Detection and Classification System
---

An automated system that detects and classifies defects in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) images using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system compares a reference PCB template with a test image, highlights defect regions, classifies defects, and provides downloadable results through a user-friendly interface.
